# BlueRevilResistome


The <a href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/blue-devil-resistome-project-2017-2018" target="_blank"> Blue Devil Resistome Project </a> aims to better understand the potential risks associated with healthcare centers, environmental microbes, and infectious diseases through mapping the distribution of antibiotic-resistance genes across the Duke campus.

This repository contains relevant code for the Red Team, which is responsible for creating a database to document the information collected, developing a dynamic web interface for easy querying and data visualization, and any additional development of computational tools/software to analyze and disseminate the data.
